     <h1>About the owner</h1>
     <p>The Owner is known as Red Guy is a very private being. What is known is that they have curly purple hair and red skin. The land which the are from can't be spelled with any Earthly letter and is one degree colder than the sun. Once a great land filled with plant life and music. Now it's a shell of it's former self and is so unbareable that only one being is left after it's grand exodos.</p>
